# Smoke Detector using Arduino

🚨 A beginner-friendly smoke detection system using MQ-2 gas sensor and Arduino Uno with a buzzer alert.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- USB cable for Arduino

## 💡 How It Works
- The MQ-2 sensor detects smoke/gas levels.
- If the sensor value crosses a threshold (e.g., 800), the buzzer is triggered.
- Values are displayed on the Serial Monitor for monitoring.

## 📁 File Info
- `smoke-detector.ino`: Arduino code for the project.

## ✅ Output
- "GAS DETECTED" appears in Serial Monitor.
- Buzzer activates when smoke is detected.

## 📸 Future Enhancements
- Add an LED indicator.
- Connect to IoT (like Blynk) for remote alerts.
- Use a display module to show gas level.
